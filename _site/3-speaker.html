<p><strong>Talk</strong>: <em>Let’s Build an Open Programmable Virtual Assistant with Privacy</em></p>

<p><strong>Bio</strong>: Monica Lam is a Professor in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University since 1988. She is the faculty director of the Open Virtual Assistant Lab (OVAL). She received a B.Sc. from University of British Columbia in 1980 and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1987. Monica is a Member of the National Academy of Engineering and Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Fellow. She is a co-author of the popular text Compilers, Principles, Techniques, and Tools (2nd Edition), also known as Dragon book.</p>

<p>She is the PI of the NSF Research Award “Autonomy and Privacy with Open Federated Virtual Assistants”. This project combines machine learning, natural language processing, programming systems, distributed systems, human-computer interaction, blockchain technology to create an open-source assistant that promotes consumer privacy and open competition. Her Almond research project is the first virtual assistant that lets users share their digital assets easily in natural language, without disclosing any information to a third party. It receives Popular Science’s Best of What’s New Award in Security in 2019.</p>
